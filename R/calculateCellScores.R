#' Calculate Cell Phenotype Scores
#'
#' This function calculates phenotype scores for each cell based on the association of its neighborhoods with particular phenotypes. 
#' The scores are derived from the log fold change (logFC) values in the `neighborhoodPhenotypeAssociations` data structure and 
#' are adjusted by the distances between cells and neighborhood centers.
#'
#' @param milo_obj A `Milo` class object, containing the neighborhood connectivity matrix (`@nhoods`) and cell metadata (`@colData`).
#' @param neighborhoodPhenotypeAssociations A list where each element corresponds to a phenotype and contains a data frame with neighborhood-level associations. Produced by `calculateNeighborhoodCenterMatrix`.
#' @param cellNeighborhoodDistanceMatrix A matrix representing the Euclidean distances between cells and the neighborhoods in which they are included, output of `cellNeighborhoodDistanceMatrix`.
#' @param col_name The name of the column in `milo_obj@colData` that contains the cell identifiers.
#' @param varsToTest A character vector of phenotypes for which to calculate cell scores.
#'
#' @return A data frame where each column corresponds to a phenotype, and each row corresponds to a cell, containing the calculated phenotype scores for each cell.

#' Calculate Weighted Average of Sparse Matrices

#'
#' @return A numeric vector of weighted averages for each column of the input matrices.
